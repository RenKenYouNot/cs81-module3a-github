I found the GitHub system useful, but also pretty confusing at first.

Remembering to find the right directories in my terminal before trying to change my code was difficult because I'm not used to using code to locate and store information on my computer. I also struggled to remember to use git push to actually save my work into my GitHub repository.

I understand why developers use GitHub now. It's not just about saving things directly; a huge benefit is being able to see the entire history of commits. So if something goes wrong in their code, they can easily figure out which version caused the problem, which is helpful for debugging.
